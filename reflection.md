I found this assignment challenging before attending today's class. After class today though I felt a lot better about completing this assignement because we discussed different types of encasulation and how to acess and use the methods of classes in other classes. At first, I was very confused about how to say access the car methods in the train class but after seeing other examples and completing this assignment I feel a lot more confident. Encapsulation makes programming effcient because you can distibute the tasks(methods) among different objects. This way you only have to write a method once and then can access it in different classes and do not have to rewrite them. 

Something I struggled with was determining if I had to pass in a variable into a function or if I could already acess it because the class already knew what I was talking about/it was already constructed. I think I'm still a little shaky with this concept but doing this assignment helped. I would advise students to look at other examples from class of encapsulation to see how classes can be accessed and their methods can be used in other places.
